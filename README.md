STEP 01 — Project foundation
මුලින් AI එකට:
“Start with Phase 1 only. Create the complete React + TypeScript + Vite project architecture and design system. Do not move to Phase 2 until Phase 1 is working and builds successfully.”
කියන්න.
ඊට පස්සේ:
STEP 02 — Firebase
“Now implement Phase 2. Configure Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Storage, environment variables, service layer, security-rule files and indexes. Do not use fake credentials. Create .env.example and explain exactly what values I need to add.”
STEP 03 — Frontend
ඊළඟට:
“Implement Phase 3 completely. Build the public website shell, navigation, hero, homepage sections, footer, responsive layouts, theme system and animation system. All content that belongs in CMS must use the Firebase data layer rather than hard-coded production content.”
STEP 04 — Portfolio systems
“Implement Phase 4 completely: Projects, Photography, Writing, Services, Skills, Experience and Testimonials. Build reusable components, Firestore schemas, public pages and detail pages. Do not invent personal data.”
STEP 05 — Admin
“Implement Phase 5 completely. Build the protected Admin Dashboard with Firebase Authentication, role-based authorization, responsive admin navigation and all CMS management screens.”
STEP 06 — Real CRUD
“Implement Phase 6 completely. Connect every Admin CRUD form to Firestore and Storage. Add validation, duplicate, publish/unpublish, feature, visibility, reorder, delete confirmation, loading, success, error and empty states. No mock functionality.”
STEP 07 — REAL-TIME
මේක අනිවාර්යයෙන්ම දාන්න:
“Implement Phase 7. Use Firestore real-time listeners where appropriate so changes made in Admin Dashboard appear on the public website automatically without rebuilding or redeploying the application. Verify this behavior for hero, services, projects, photography, writing, navigation, theme, social links and homepage section visibility/order.”
STEP 08 — Security
“Implement Phase 8. Audit and deploy-ready Firestore Security Rules, Firebase Storage Rules, indexes and role-based access control. Verify that public users cannot access admin-only data and cannot elevate their own role.”
STEP 09 — Performance + SEO
“Implement Phase 9. Optimize image loading, code splitting, responsive images, caching, Core Web Vitals, accessibility, metadata, Open Graph, sitemap, robots and structured data. Do not sacrifice image quality unnecessarily.”
STEP 10 — Final QA
අන්තිමට මේක දාන්න:
“Perform Phase 10 as a complete production QA audit. Do not only report problems. Inspect the entire codebase, find bugs and incomplete functionality, then fix them. Verify npm run build, all routes, authentication, Firestore CRUD, Storage, security rules, real-time updates, responsive behavior, accessibility, SEO, loading/error/empty states and Admin/Public synchronization.”

You are an expert senior full-stack engineer, UI/UX designer, creative director, database architect, Firebase engineer, security engineer, SEO specialist, accessibility specialist, and performance engineer.

Build a complete, production-ready, premium personal creative portfolio website using React.js.

Never allow frontend users to modify their own role.

==================================================
55. REAL-TIME CMS MODEL

Public site data should come from Firebase.

Example:

Firestore:

settings/site
settings/theme
hero/main
about/main
seo/global

services/{serviceId}
projects/{projectId}
photographyAlbums/{albumId}
writing/{postId}

Public React app:

Firebase listener
→ state/cache
→ UI

Admin:

Form
→ validation
→ Firestore write
→ real-time listener
→ public UI updates

==================================================
56. EMPTY STATES

If no:

projects
services
testimonials
writing
photography

exist, do not show broken sections.

Use elegant CMS-aware empty states.

Admin should show:

After implementing everything, behave like a senior QA engineer.

Inspect the entire project.

Find and fix:

- broken routes
- broken imports
- TypeScript errors
- Firebase configuration errors
- Firestore permission errors
- Storage permission errors
- authentication problems
- mobile layout issues
- desktop layout issues
- accessibility problems
- SEO issues
- performance issues
- race conditions
- loading problems
- empty states
- missing error states
- duplicate code
- dead UI controls
- fake functionality
- hard-coded content that should be CMS-controlled

Do not simply report issues.

Fix them.

==================================================
62. IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION RULE

DO NOT generate everything as one enormous file.

Build the project as a real maintainable application.

Use modular architecture.

If a feature is too large, split it into:

components
hooks
services
types
pages
utilities

==================================================
63. DELIVERY FORMAT

When generating the project:

First create the architecture.

Then implement:

PHASE 1
Project setup
React
TypeScript
Vite
Tailwind
routing
design tokens

PHASE 2
Firebase
Auth
Firestore
Storage
environment configuration

PHASE 3
Public layout
navigation
hero
sections
footer

PHASE 4
Projects
Photography
Writing
Services
Skills
Experience
Testimonials

PHASE 5
Admin authentication
Admin dashboard
CMS

PHASE 6
CRUD
Media Library
Messages
Navigation
SEO
Theme

PHASE 7
Real-time synchronization

PHASE 8
Security Rules
Storage Rules
Indexes

PHASE 9
Performance
SEO
Accessibility
Responsive optimization

PHASE 10
Testing
QA
production build
deployment documentation

==================================================
64. DO NOT STOP AT UI

This instruction is extremely important.

Do NOT stop after creating the frontend.

Do NOT create a beautiful UI with fake buttons.

Every important admin control must connect to real data.

Every CMS record must be persisted.

Every public page must consume the appropriate data.

Every protected operation must be authorized.

==================================================
65. DO NOT INVENT PERSONAL DATA

I will provide personal information separately.

Do NOT create or assume:

- real name
- address
- phone number
- email
- social media URLs
- clients
- awards
- qualifications
- certifications
- employment history
- testimonials
- project results

Use placeholders or empty CMS states.

==================================================
66. FINAL DESIGN DIRECTION

The visual result should feel like:

Premium Creative Portfolio
+
Editorial Magazine
+
Photography Studio
+
Modern Digital Agency
+
High-End Personal Brand

Design characteristics:

- dark-first
- sophisticated
- cinematic
- minimal
- editorial
- asymmetric layouts where appropriate
- strong typography
- high-quality imagery
- precise spacing
- subtle motion
- intelligent micro-interactions
- strong grid systems
- premium hover states
- restrained color palette

Do not make it look like:

- generic AI website
- Bootstrap template
- SaaS dashboard
- gaming website
- crypto website
- excessive cyberpunk UI
- neon landing page

==================================================
67. FINAL SUCCESS CRITERIA

The project is considered successful only when:

1. React application runs.
2. Production build succeeds.
3. Firebase integration works.
4. Admin authentication works.
5. Firestore CRUD works.

Build this as a real production application, not a visual demonstration.
